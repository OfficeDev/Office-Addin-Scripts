# Office-Addin-Scripts

This repository contains packages which provide scripts used to automate tasks related to Office Add-ins.

These packages have been developed initially for debugging Office Add-ins which use the JavaScript runtime directly. You can see how these are used in the [Excel Custom Functions](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Excel-Custom-Functions) project.
